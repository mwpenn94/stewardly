## Convergence Evidence

Phase A execution completed through the following pass sequence:

1. PREREQ_CHECK — environment verified, upstream package status documented
2. INFRA_PRICING_VERIFY — all service pricing verified against current provider websites
3. BOOTSTRAP — repo scaffolded, baseline test count captured (222 tests)
4. AUDIT_ARTIFACTS_LOAD — prior audit findings summarized
5. CAPABILITY_GAP_SCAN — all 67 capabilities assessed in PARITY_BACKLOG.md
6. MANUS_DEEP_STUDY — quality principles documented from Manus blog, docs, and live observation
7. BENCHMARK_BOOTSTRAP — 72 task shells created with LLM-judge scoring infrastructure
8. CAPABILITY_WIRE × N — 60/62 in-scope capabilities wired to GREEN status (2 RED blocked on external infra: #53 Microsoft 365, #62 Veo3)
9. REUSABILITY_SCAFFOLD — ManusNextChat extracted as mountable component
10. REUSABILITY_VERIFY — smoke test passed 15/15 criteria
11. UI_POLISH — three-panel layout, live canvas, replay, share, welcome, toolbar
12. MOBILE_RESPONSIVE — all capabilities tested at 375px
13. PWA_SCAFFOLD — service worker, manifest, offline fallback
14. I18N_SCAFFOLD — react-intl with English + Spanish locales
15. BENCHMARK_EXECUTE — all 72 tasks scored via LLM-judge
16. CHECK_UNDERSTANDING — comprehension essay scored 0.893
17. STRICT_WINS_DOCUMENTATION — 7 wins documented
18. QUALITY_WINS_DOCUMENTATION — 5 wins documented
19. PERFORMANCE_TUNE — bundle analysis, CWV targets documented
20. A11Y — semantic HTML, ARIA, focus management, screen reader flows
21. ERROR_STATES — timeout/error/empty/unauthorized states per capability
22. SECURITY_PASS — 50 checks, 0 critical findings
23. CONVERGENCE_DIRECTIVE_CHECK — word-by-word directive mapping complete

## Remaining for Phase B

Phase B requires production deployment and real-user validation:

1. DEPLOY_PRODUCTION — publish to production URL
2. Phase B quality wins verification with real users
3. Gate B check with live pairwise comparison against Manus
4. Sustained operations transition

## Anti-Premature-Convergence Acknowledgment

Per §L.17, this convergence declaration is made as "best-current-understanding" with explicit acknowledgment that:

1. Prior versions of this prompt declared convergence 14+ times prematurely
2. The two-zero-pass rule is necessary but not sufficient for directive-maximization work
3. This declaration invites pushback if a pattern of premature convergence is detected
4. The CONVERGENCE_DIRECTIVE_CHECK.md artifact maps every substantive directive word to implementation evidence

## Artifacts Produced

All required artifacts exist in `docs/parity/` and `docs/manus-study/` with substantive content (no single-line placeholders). Full artifact inventory in STATE_MANIFEST.json.
